        "A neuron, also known as a artificial neuron or perceptron, is the fundamental building block of a neural network. It is inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons in the human brain. An artificial neuron takes one or more inputs, applies weights to those inputs, sums them up, and passes the result through an activation function to produce an output. The activation function introduces non-linearity and determines the neuron's response based on the summed input. The output of a neuron can then be used as input to other neurons in the network.\n",

It consists of multiple layers of neurons, typically organized into input, hidden, and output layers. The input layer receives the initial data, the hidden layers perform intermediate computations, and the output layer produces the final result. Each neuron in a neural network is responsible for processing a subset of the input data and passing its output to the neurons in the next layer. The connections between neurons in the network are weighted, allowing the network to learn and adapt through a process called training, typically using techniques such as gradient descent and backpropagation.\n",
